Any time multiple electron configurations become close in energy, however, HF is in trouble. Multiple determinants become necessary to describe the important electron configurations. CI is the first of many theories that include these multiple configurations.\n",

    "HF theory describes one kind of electron correlation exactly –– exchange correlation. The observation that electrons of the same spin avoid each other due to the antisymmetric nature of the spatial wavefunction, for example the $^3_1\\psi$, is called a \"Fermi hole.\" Because, for a triplet, the spins are identical, the spatial part of the wavefunction must have the minus sign, and the electrons cannot be in the same location. The HF triplet energy for H$_2$ is essentially correct because of this cancellation. Notice that the open-shell singlet tends to pair the electrons in the same region of space because the spatial wavefunction must be symmetric with respect to exchange. This effect is called a \"Fermi heap.\" \n",
